# Tube Umbrella

- This website was designed to provide users with the option to search for video across a variety of hosting websites.  

- A simple minimalist design allows users to enter their search term in the field at the top of the page and displays results in four columns.  

- The first three columns are from free services: (*youtube, dailymotion, vimeo*) using their respective apis

- The last column is from a variety of paid services using the *watchmode* api

- the sql alchemy database saves commonly searched for phrases and provides a quicker response time when a user searches for a phrase that was previously queried

- This was made with Python3, Flask and Javascript -
